# Stamp Scanner Application

This application is designed to help users identify and manage their stamp collections.

## Features (Planned)

*   **Stamp Detection:** Users can upload images of stamps, and the application will attempt to detect and isolate individual stamps.
*   **Information Retrieval:** For detected stamps, the application will try to fetch information from online resources (e.g., stamp catalogs, philatelic websites).
*   **Collection Management:** Users can store information about their stamps in a local database, including details like country of origin, year of issue, estimated value, and notes.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Users will be able to search and filter their collection based on various criteria.

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the core Python source code for the application.
    *   `main.py`: The main entry point and orchestrator of the application.
    *   `image_processing.py`: Handles image loading, stamp detection, and segmentation.
    *   `web_retrieval.py`: Responsible for fetching stamp information from online sources.
    *   `db_utils.py`: Manages interactions with the local stamp database.
*   `data/`: Stores application data.
    *   `uploaded_images/`: Stores the original images uploaded by users.
